# Unit 3 - Translation I

## I. Put the following text into Chinese

The plane arcs softly into its final descent at Hong Kong International Airport. Below are Victoria Harbor and the silent rhythms of countless ships. Beyond, sloping mountains fence in a breathtaking city view that seems to stretch forever. This is no ordinary airport. This is no ordinary city. An elderly man passes by wearing pajamas, bearing a brightly feathered bird singing merrily in its cage. Professionals gather at a roadside kitchen for noodles, congee and shrimp. Incense from a tiny Taoist temple drifts into the pounding beat of rock music pouring out of a discotheque. A ferry travels on the nearby water regularly, taking passengers to an isolated island 40 minutes away, where Buddhist temples and tiny fishing villages dot the landscape. Hong Kong, 161 km south of the Tropic of Cancer, beats the pulse of Southeast Asia’s heart, where East greets West, and past colors present themselves.

飞机划着柔和的弧线最终降落到香港国际机场。俯瞰，维多利亚港，无数的船只演奏着无声的旋律。眺望，依山而立令人叹为观止的城市风景一望无际。这不是一个普通的机场。这也不是一座普通的城市。一位穿着睡衣的老人从旁边走过，手上提着一个鸟笼，一只颜色鲜艳的鸟儿在里面欢快地歌唱。上班一族聚在路边的餐馆里吃面条，喝粥，吃小虾。一个小道观里飘出来的檀香混杂着从迪斯科厅里流出的摇滚乐有力的节奏，浑然一体。一只渡船穿梭在附近的水面上，把乘客们带到离此处40分钟里程的一座孤岛上，岛上，寺庙和渔村交相辉映。香港，在北回归线以南161公里处，如同东南亚的心脏时刻搏动；这里东西交融，时光汇聚。
