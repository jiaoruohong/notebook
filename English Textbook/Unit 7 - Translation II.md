# Unit 7 - Translation II

## II. Put the following text into English

“弟子不必不如师，师不必贤于弟子”，这是一个真理，并不是瞎说。老师和学生并没有什么不可逾越的界限。在这门知识上老师高于学生，在另一门知识上，学生也可能高于老师；今天老师高于学生，明天学生可能高过老师。这也是辩证法，对立面的统一。老师和学生可以相互转换，学生要向老师学习，老师也有需要向学生学习之处。新的师生关系，是“不耻相师”。就是互为老师，互为学生，彼此平等，不分尊卑，真正是“道之所存，师之所存”，谁有学问谁就是老师。

"Pupils are not necessarily inferior to their teachers, nor eachers better than their pupils" -- that is a truth, not a fallacy. There is no impassable demarcation line between teacher and pupil. While a teacher may be superior to his pupils in one branch of knowledge, the latter may be superior to the former in another. While the teacher may be superior to his pupil today, the latter may be superior to the former tomorrow. That demonstrates the law of dialectics and the unity of opposites. A kind of interplay exists between teacher and pupil. The pupil should learn from his teacher, but sometimes there may also be something the teacher has to learn from his pupils. The new relationship between teacher and pupil should be that if not being ashamed to learn from each other," That is to say, teacher and pupils should teach each other and learn from each from. They should treat each other as equals regardless of seniority so that, as the saying goes, "Whoever knows the truth can be a teacher."
