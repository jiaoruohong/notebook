## II. Put the following text into English

当世界疯狂时，一个数学家可以在数学中发现一种无与伦比的镇静剂。在所有艺术和科学之中，数学是最朴实而且也是也是最细微的。同时，数学家在所有人里应该是最容易超脱于世的，恰如罗素所言，“至少一种冲动与不安可以从沉闷而乏味的现实中得以解脱。”遗憾的是，这里必须提出一个非常严格的限制条件，即数学家一定不能太老。数学是一种创造性而不是默想的学科。没有人可以在失去能力或不再有创造欲望时还能从数学这一学科中得到慰藉。这种失去能力与创造愿望的情况可能会很快在一个数学家身上发生，非常可悲。在这种情况下，他就不是什么重要角色，也用不着为他操心了。

When the world is mad, a mathematician may find in mathematics an incomparable anodyne. For mathematics is, of all the arts and sciences, the most austere and the most remote, and a mathematician should be of all men the one who can most easily take refuge where, as Bertrand Russell says, 'one at least of our nobler impulses can best escape from the dreary exile of the actual world.' It is a pity that it should be necessary to make one very serious reservation -- he must not be too old. Mathematics is not a contemplative but a creative subject; no one can draw much consolation from it when he has lost the power or the desire to create; and that is apt to happen to a mathematician rather soon. It is a pity, but in that case he does not matter a great deal anyhow, and it would be silly to bother about him.
