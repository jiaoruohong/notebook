Mentoring includes powerful explicit and implicit elements. Explicit mentoring processes involve the activate transmission of facts, techniques, and systems of thought, through overt and deliberate processes in which the mentor acts in teacher, advisor, and sponsor roles. Under this rubric might be included career counseling, professional socialization, and guidance in clinical or experimental techniques or systems of diagnostic or therapeutic thinking. Implicit processes, conversely, are not consciously or deliberately displayed. They involve the exemplar role of the mentor: intellectual style, professional priorities, deliberateness, truth telling, and the flavor of interpersonal relationships are transmitted through implicit mechanisms. Elements of scholar lines, thoroughness, and loyalty, as well as styles of interactions with patients, peers, and juniors, are also powerfully displayed in implicit fashion. Implicit processes include also demonstration of the important set of characteristics and functions that McDermott referred to as the Samaritan functions of the physician — this elements of support, empathy, and identification with the suffering of the patients that characterize doctoring at its best.

导师指导包括外显和内在两方面重要因素。外显因素包括事实、技术和思想体系的有效传播。在这个显性的、精密筹划的过程中，导师扮演教师、顾问和资助人等多重角色。在这个过程中，指导还包括咨询，专业沟通，在临床或实验技能、诊断或治疗方法等方面加以引导。与之相反，内在因素不是一种主动或下意识行为。通过它们，导师发挥一种示范作用，从智力风格、专业优势、审慎、实事求是、以及人际关系方式等方面展现出来。学识、细致、忠诚，以及与患者、同行和年青人之间的相处方式，也都通过内在方式得以展现。此外，内在方式还包括麦克德莫特所说的撒马利亚式行为，在医生身上表现为乐于助人、同情患者，以及对痛苦的理解，这些都是诊疗工作最突出的特点。
