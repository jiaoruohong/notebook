# Unit 7 - Translation I

I. Put the following text into Chinese.

Mentoring includes powerful explicit and implicit elements. Explicit mentoring processes involve the activate transmission of facts, techniques, and systems of thought, through overt and deliberate processes in which the mentor acts in teacher, advisor, and sponsor roles. Under this rubric might be included career counseling, professional socialization, and guidance in clinical or experimental techniques or systems of diagnostic or therapeutic thinking. Implicit processes, conversely, are not consciously or deliberately displayed. They involve the exemplar role of the mentor: intellectual style, professional priorities, deliberateness, truth telling, and the flavor of interpersonal relationships are transmitted through implicit mechanisms. Elements of scholar lines, thoroughness, and loyalty, as well as styles of interactions with patients, peers, and juniors, are also powerfully displayed in implicit fashion. Implicit processes include also demonstration of the important set of characteristics and functions that McDermott referred to as the Samaritan functions of the physician â€” this elements of support, empathy, and identification with the suffering of the patients that characterize doctoring at its best.
