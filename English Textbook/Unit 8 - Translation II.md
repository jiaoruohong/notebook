## II. Put the following text into English

一门科学，它研究某一类事物，研究这一类事物里各个成员的变化以及这些成员之间的关系。因此，自然科学的理想形式是与数学的理想形式相同的。自然科学的目的是去发现这样一些关系，即在某种情况下有事件P出现时，一定也有事件Q出现。当一门科学以描述性的定性阶段发展到能以定量和解释的方式表达相互关系的阶段时，该门科学就以数学的形式出现了。天文学曾一度是一门描述性的科学。但是，开普勒（Kepler）和牛顿（Newton）的工作确立了这样的基础，利用这些基础，天体运动规律可用数学来表示。正是在这个意义上，数学有时被称为“科学的语言”。当科学的结论采用定量的形式表达，并频繁地启发新的实验时，就要使用数学的假设命题了；另一方面，观察到的科学数据及其复杂，会刺激数学的发展，并拓宽数学的基础。

A branch of science deals with a class of things, and the relations between these membersThus the ideal form of a natural science is the same as that of mathematics. The objective in a natural science is to discover relations which assert that if an event P is present in a situation, then the event Q also present. As a branch of science advances/develops from a descriptive and qualitative stage to one where the relations can be expressed in a quantitative and explanatory manner, the science assumes/takes on a mathematical form. Astronomy at one time was a descriptive science, but work of Kepler and Newton established foundations, by means of which the laws of the heavenly bodies’ motions could be expressed mathematically. It is in this sense that mathematics is sometimes called the language of science. When the scientific conclusions take on/assumes a quantitative form and frequently suggest new experiments, the hypothetical propositions of mathematics are called into play/in need; while, on the other hand, complexities in observed data of science stimulate the development of mathematics and broaden its foundation.
