## II. Put the following text into English

南京，她自新中国建立以来发生的巨大而深刻的变化更加令人欢欣鼓舞。“虎踞龙盘今胜昔，天翻地覆慨而慷。“从1949年4月23日开始，人民真正成为这座古老城市的主人。金陵回春，古城新生，昔日饱尝的屈辱和灾难，至此如同梦魇终被摆脱。人民在自己的土地上辛勤劳作，把古城南京装扮得面貌一新。特别是近四十年来，改革开放又给这座美丽的名城注入新的活力，崭新的工业、通达的运输、如画的城市建设、兴盛的第三产业、多彩的文化生活，都使这个具有古都特色的现代都市焕发出勃勃英姿。孙中山先生所预言的”南京将来之发展未可限量也“正在逐步成为现实。

The tremendous changes that have taken place in Nanjing since New China was founded are even more inspiring, just as the much quoted couplet from a poem written by the late Chairman Mao Zedong on the occasion of the liberation of the city on April 23, 1949 has it:

The city, a tiger crouching, a dragon curling, outshines its ancient glories;

In heroic triumph heaven and earth have been overturned.

Balmy spring winds returned to bring new life to this historic city, of which the common people came to be the genuine masters. The night marish sufferings and humiliations of the past were left behind once and for all. The citizens of Nanjing have been working hard to give this age-old town a new appearance. Especially for the past four decades, the country's reform and opening-up policy has infused new vigor into this beautiful and famous city. Newly built industries, an efficient transportation network extending in all directions, picturesque urban construction, a booming tertiary industry, a varied and colorful cultural life, all these and more added charm and vitality to this modern metropolis, which retains somehow the ambiance and features of an ancient capital. The prophecy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen father of modern China that "Nanjing will have a future that knows no bounds." is becoming true.
