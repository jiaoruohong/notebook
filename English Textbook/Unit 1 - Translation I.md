# Unit 1 - Translation I

## I. Put the following text into Chinese.

No doubt everyone has to apologize for his life, sooner or later. When we appear at the Last Judgment and the Recording Angel reads out a list of our sins, we will presumably be given an opportunity to apologize, in the old sense of rebuttal, and in the new sense too, by way of confession and plea of repentance. In this life, it is well to apologize (in the new sense), but promptly, voluntarily, fully and sincerely. If the error is a matter of opinion and unpunishable, so much the better — an apology then becomes a gracious and creditable occasion, and an example to all. An enforced apology is. A miserable affair.

Besides, there is something distinguished about a ready apology. It is. The mark of a gentleman, more particularly if it is not necessary. It is the opposite of revenge. Bacon wrote, “In seeking revenge, a man is but equal with his enemy, but in forgiving him, he is superior, for it is a prince’s part to pardon.” So, the person who apologizes freely has the moral.  Ball in his court.
